# Java-Maze-Solver-Project-Data-Structures-Algorithms
This project implements core graph algorithms and data structures in Java, including Kruskal’s algorithm for minimum spanning trees and Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths. The algorithms are applied to generate and solve mazes through a provided graphical interface.
